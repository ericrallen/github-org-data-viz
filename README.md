# github-org-data-viz

This project provides simple insights into the public contribution activity of a
GitHub Organization.

## Current Considerations

Pagination is not yet implemented, so for larger organizations, you'll only
see the first `100` members.

Furutre repository and contribution insights will only include the `100` most
recently updated repositories.

## Using

1. `git clone` this repo
2. `cd` into your new repo
3. `yarn`
4. `yarn start`
5. Enter the desired organization name into the search box.
